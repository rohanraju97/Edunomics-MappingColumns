PLEASE READ THIS!
I tried to implement all this on a Desktop App. I used the Electron Framework because I am quite familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which is what Electron is based on. However, it turned out to be quite complex and unnecessary. I needed to learn fresh new APIs to deal with Electron. I am used to the regular Node.js APIs. Also, I wrote the entire searching script in Python. Integrating the python script into the Electron app was an added difficulty. I thought of porting the Python Script to JavaScript Code, but JS doesn't make use of some handy libraries that I used, like Pandas. All in all, I was unable to get the basic functionality up and running of a desktop app.

I CAN DO IT VERY EASILY ON A WEB APP THOUGH!
